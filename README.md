# Project Description

## EZCargo ðŸš¢

EZCargo is a cutting-edge system designed to simplify and optimize cargo operations for shipping companies. Whether itâ€™s loading, unloading, or ensuring proper balance, EZCargo ensures efficiency, safety, and compliance with industry standards.

## Primary Tasks:
Loading and Unloading Containers: Allow operators to ask for an "optimal sequence of moves."
Balancing: Provide an algorithm to balance the ship's load, ensuring the left and right sides differ by no more than 10%.
Separation of Operations:
Ensure that load/unload and balance are distinct operations and cannot occur simultaneously.
