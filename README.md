# Project Description

## Frameworks Used

### Flask
- API endpoints (e.g., routes for data submission and retrieval).
- Serving static files (if needed, like a bundled React app).
- Flask creates a REST API that React (frontend) can call using HTTP requests.
-API endpoints are defined in Flask, e.g., /run-algorithm or /submit-comment.
### Axios
- For API calls
- Simplifies making API calls (GET, POST, PUT, DELETE) for Flask backend.
### React
- Frontend for User Interface
- React communicates with Flask by sending requests to Flaskâ€™s API endpoints.
## EZCargo ðŸš¢

EZCargo is a cutting-edge system designed to simplify and optimize cargo operations for shipping companies. Whether itâ€™s loading, unloading, or ensuring proper balance, EZCargo ensures efficiency, safety, and compliance with industry standards.

extra pip installs:
pip install flask-cors (For Connecting Flask and React)

## Primary Tasks:
Loading and Unloading Containers: Allow operators to ask for an "optimal sequence of moves."
Balancing: Provide an algorithm to balance the ship's load, ensuring the left and right sides differ by no more than 10%.
Separation of Operations:
Ensure that load/unload and balance are distinct operations and cannot occur simultaneously.
